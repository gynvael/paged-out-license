### Paged Out! - Standard Author's Agreement

Version: 0.0.7 (last updated: 2023-08-31)

This document is an agreement between the Author of a one-page article and the Paged Out! Institute (represented by Gynvael Coldwind). While normally such documents contain a lot of legal language, we'll try to keep it sane and short - after all, Paged Out! is a project from the community, for the community, and not a business venture.

There are two main purposes of this agreement:

- First and foremost, to make sure that we are able to publish the article as part of the Paged Out! project, and that the readers can download it, read it, print it and redistribute it in its published form.
- Additionally, while Paged Out! is going to be distributed in electronic form for free and we do not expect to earn any money from it (though we would like it to be self-sustained at some point), we would like to get any potential income distribution sorted out as well (so this doesn't block any potential project growth in the future).

If you have any questions about the agreement, or would like to have a customized one, feel free to reach out to [gynvael@pagedout.institute](mailto:gynvael@pagedout.institute).

#### Standard Author's Agreement

1. The Author confirms that they understand that the Paged Out! Institute is just a bunch of technical folks publishing a free Internet zin, and not a real institute/publishing house. :)
2. The Author grants the Paged Out! Institute all required rights to the submitted article to distribute the article for free as part of the Paged Out! magazine for anyone to download, read, print and redistribute (in its published form). These rights are granted free of charge and under the assumption that Paged Out! is a freely distributed magazine.
3. The Author confirms that they have all required copyrights to be able to grant the rights mentioned above.
4. The granted rights are non-exclusive (meaning the Author can publish the one-page article somewhere else any time they wish).
5. The Paged Out! Institute will review the article and can suggest changes and modifications (and there can be multiple rounds of back-and-forth if required), and in the end will decide whether the article is accepted.
6. In case the article is not accepted (e.g. both sides can't reach an agreement on the final content/form of the article) this Author's Agreement is assumed to no longer be in effect (i.e. all the rights granted by the Author to the Paged Out! Institute are revoked).
7. In the unlikely case of any money coming into the project (e.g. a sponsor appears, or we manage to sell an ad or five) the profit (i.e. revenue minus costs) will be shared the following way:
    - 75% of profit is distributed among all eligible Authors whose articles were directly involved in the money coming into the project.
    - 25% of profit goes to Paged Out! Institute's staff for tea, beer or whatever.
    - Example: In Issue 123 of the magazine there were 75 articles and 2 ads (sold in total for $1100). The Paged Out! Institute staff paid $100 for DTP and cool layout for that exact Issue. The costs ($100) are deducted from the revenue ($1100), so there is $1000 profit. (the Paged Out! Institute had $100000 costs for previous issues? Tough luck. Costs from other issues cannot and will not be deducted from the profit from this issue. The staff can only hope that their share of the profit covers past costs eventually.) The $1000 profit is shared as $750 to the Authors, and $250 to the staff. There were 75 articles, meaning each article will get $10 (yeah, that's not a lot). If an Author had 2 published articles in that issue, they would obviously get $20 (i.e. $10 per article).

8. The key phrase "eligible Author" above means there is no local or international law (e.g. sanctions/embargoes) that would prevent us from paying out money to the given Author.
9. The profit sharing is optional and the Author can choose to not participate in it (e.g. because of disliking tax related paperwork, sharing private details or some other reason). In such case the Author needs to decide whether their share of the profit:
    - Goes back into the pool to be shared between other Authors.
    - Goes to the Paged Out! Institute staff as a tip.

10. In case the Author chooses to participate in profit sharing, and in the unlikely event of actual profit, the Paged Out! Institute or the company handling this for the Institute will reach out to the Author with additional paperwork (e.g. tax-related) as required by law. The Author will then have have a limited (but reasonable) time to send the paperwork in. Please note this will require sharing personal information (likely: full name, address, tax identification details, bank account or paypal, etc.) with the Paged Out! Institute staff and/or the company managing payouts on behalf of Paged Out! Institute.
10.a. Any unclaimed profit sharing based license fee expire after 1 calendar year or if the Author informs Paged Out! that they are no longer interested in receiving the payout (whichever comes first). In such case the expired amount is considered forfeit and remains with the Paged Out! Institute to be used for bills, covering various costs, staff tips, tea, donations, and so on.
11. In case of a payout, any transfer fees will be deducted from the Author's share, however the Paged Out! Institute will work with the Author to make sure these are minimal. Payouts will take place only when the collected amount exceeds $25 per given author or on Author's request for smaller amounts (this is so that we don't bug you for every $1 - it would be counterproductive for both sides).
12. Optionally the Author can agree (and therefore grant all required rights to the Paged Out! Institute) for their article to be re-used in spin-off projects, if any (e.g. nicely printed and sold Collector's Editions or translations into other languages published in different magazines, etc.). The Author will be notified each time that the article will be used, and in case of any profit the rules described above apply.
13. Optionally the Author can also agree for their article to be recorded in audio form (this means both reading the article, but also coming up with spoken depictions of illustrations) and distributed in free audio form by others (this might be useful for visually impaired folks on our scene, but also makes for a cool podcast).

#### Selected agreement variant

When submitting an article to Paged Out! you will receive a form link from us where we will ask you about your preferences regarding the optional clauses. Option preview:

1. Audio recordings of the article:
    * I agree for others to create audio recordings of my article and to distribute them.
    * My will is that others DO NOT distribute audio recordings of my article.

2. Profit sharing participation:
    * I want to participate in profit sharing (if there is any profit that is).
    * I DO NOT want to participate in profit sharing.

3. Only if the Author doesn't want to participate in profit sharing:
    * My share should go back into the pool.
    * I like the work Paged Out! Institute does! I want to tip them! (Thanks!)

4. Optional article reuse:
    * I want my article to be re-used in spin-off projects too! (Points 2 and 3 apply for spin-off projects as well!)
    * I want my article to be only used in the single issue of Paged Out! magazine for which I submitted it.

#### Official short names for license variants

In order to optimize referring to specific variant selections, we will use (especially internally) short names for the various options. The short names will be created in the following manner:

* All short names will start with `SAA` and end with the version number after a single space (e.g. ` 0.0.7`).
* In case The Author DOES NOT want to participate in profit sharing, and:
    * wants their share to go back into the pool, the suffix `-POOL` will be added,
    * wants to tip the Paged Out! Institute, the suffix `-TIP` will be added.
* In case The Author DOES NOT agree to audio recordings option, the suffix `-NA` will be added.
* In case The Author DOES NOT agree for the article to be re-used in spin-off projects, suffix `-NS` will be added.
* In case there are no suffixes, i.e. The Author agreed to the audio recording and spin-off project options, and wants to participate in profit sharing, the suffix `-ALL` will be added.

**Note:** Suffix order doesn't matter, so `SAA-NS-NA 0.0.7` is the same thing as `SAA-NA-NS 0.0.7`. We will try to use the order specified above though.

Examples (assuming license version 0.0.7 in all examples):

* If The Author agreed to audio recordings, profit sharing and spin-off projects, the short name for this variant will be `SAA-ALL 0.0.7`.
* If The Author agreed to everything, apart from profit sharing, but would like to tip the Institute, the short name will be `SAA-TIP 0.0.7`.
* If The Author does not agree to audio recording, nor spin-off projects, and does not want to participate in profit sharing (and wants their share to go back into the pool), the short name will be `SAA-POOL-NA-NS 0.0.7`.
